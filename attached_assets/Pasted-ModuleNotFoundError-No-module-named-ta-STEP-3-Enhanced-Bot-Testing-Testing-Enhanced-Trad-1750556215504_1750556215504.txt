    To use Python with Nix and nixpkgs, have a look at the online documentation:
    <https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#python>.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

📋 STEP 4: Performance Report

📊 Creating Performance Report...
📋 Training Report Summary:
   ✅ Training Completed: 
   🤖 Models Available: Basic LSTM
   📊 Performance Metrics: {}

======================================================================
🎉 ENHANCED TRAINING PIPELINE COMPLETE!
======================================================================
📊 Pipeline Success Rate: 1/4 (25.0%)

📋 Step Results:
   ❌ Enhanced Features: Failed
   ❌ Ensemble Models: Failed
   ❌ Bot Test: Failed
   ✅ Report: Success

⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
Some training steps failed, but you can still use:
- Any successfully trained models
- The existing basic trading system
- Try running individual training scripts
